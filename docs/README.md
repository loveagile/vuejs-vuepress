# VuePress

> VuePress is a minimalistic docs generator with a Vue component based layout system.

## Why

- **Writing First**: minimal setup, all you need is a markdown file.

- **Vue-powered**: Use custom Vue components inside markdown, and develop custom themes using Vue single file components.

- **Great Dev Experience**: enjoy the same enjoyable development experience of a Vue app. Leverage the full power of webpack (hot-reload, pre-processors), generate SEO-friendly static HTML, and works as an SPA after initial page load.

- **Optimized for Docs**: many [built-in markdown extensions](./markdown.md) and default theme features for writing great documentation.

- **GitHub Friendly**: source markdown files can link to each other using relative links that ends in `.md` so they are also readable on GitHub, auto-generates page edit links if a repo is provided.
